Test-Driven Learning
====================

"Learning tests aren't a part of production code; they live in a separate repository, a 
personal repository, and they help us document our knowledge and our learning experience"
Christian Johansen, "Test-Driven Javascript" (2010, Addison-Wesley Professional)
