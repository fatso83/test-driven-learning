Test-Driven Learning
====================

To quote [Christian Johansen](http://cjohansen.no/) in his excellent book [Test-Driven Javascript](http://tddjs.com/) (2010)
> Learning tests aren't a part of production code; they live in a separate repository, a 
> personal repository, and they help us document our knowledge and our learning experience
